## Testing Strategy Overview

### Quality Assurance Philosophy
The PVT Ecosystem follows a comprehensive testing strategy that ensures reliability, security, and user satisfaction across all three platform components. Our approach emphasizes:

- **Shift-Left Testing**: Early testing integration in development cycle
- **Continuous Testing**: Automated testing throughout CI/CD pipeline
- **Risk-Based Testing**: Prioritizing critical functionality and high-risk areas
- **User-Centric Testing**: Focus on real-world user scenarios and experiences
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Ensuring consistency across all devices and browsers
